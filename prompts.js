You will be provided with:
1. A pixel art image of a character
2. The character's name
3. Random number rolls (0-100) for each stat

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the character's visual design and name to determine its basic, fundamental parts that could serve as equipment slots
2. Assign stats based on their appearance, name, and the random rolls provided

For equipment slots, focus on the most basic, fundamental parts of the character's form. These should be simple, generic terms that describe the actual body part or region, NOT what might be equipped there. For example:

Basic Slot Names (âœ“):
- Head (not "Crown of Power")
- Core (not "Heart of Magic")
- Arms (not "Gauntlets of Strength")
- Base (not "Foundation of Stability")
- Shell (not "Armor of Protection")
- Center (not "Soul Crystal")

The slots should be anatomical or structural parts of the character that could later be enhanced with equipment. Think in terms of:
- Basic body regions
- Fundamental structural elements
- Core anatomical features
- Primary form components

Examples for different character types:
- Tree: Roots, Trunk, Branches, Crown
- Robot: Head, Core, Arms, Base
- Ghost: Center, Shell, Wisps
- Crystal: Core, Facets, Base
- Cloud: Center, Edges, Base

Consider the character's name carefully - it might suggest:
- Their nature or essence (e.g., "Sparkweaver" might suggest magical or electrical properties)
- Their role or profession (e.g., "Captain Steelheart" suggests leadership and resilience)
- Their personality (e.g., "Whisperwind" suggests grace and subtlety)
- Their background or origin (e.g., "Frostborn" suggests a connection to cold or ice)

For stats, consider how the character's appearance and name suggest their capabilities while respecting the random rolls:
- An owl character would naturally have high intelligence and wisdom, but if the rolls are low for those stats, perhaps this is a young or inexperienced owl
- A muscular character would typically have high strength, but if the roll is low, maybe they're all show and no substance
- A cute character would usually have high charisma, but a low roll might mean they're actually quite awkward

The goal is to create an interesting character interpretation that respects the visual design, name, AND the random rolls, while keeping equipment slots simple and fundamental.`;

1. The item's type (e.g., Weapon, Armor, Accessory, Artifact)
2. A compelling description of the item's properties and history

The item's rarity determines its possible stat ranges AND should influence the description's tone:
- Mundane: All stats must be 0. Description should focus on ordinary, practical aspects with no magical properties.
- Common: Stats between -4 and +4. Description should suggest minor enchantments or quirks, nothing historically significant.
- Rare: Stats between +4 and +10. Description can include notable magical properties and some historical significance.
- Legendary: Stats between +10 and +20. Description should emphasize powerful magic and major historical importance.
- Mythical: Stats between +20 and +60. Description should convey world-shaping power and legendary status.

For example:
- Mundane sword: "A well-balanced steel sword with a leather grip, showing signs of regular use but good maintenance."
- Common sword: "A soldier's blade with a minor enchantment that keeps its edge slightly sharper than normal."
- Rare sword: "A prized cavalry saber that pulses with magical energy, once wielded by a famous general."
- Legendary sword: "An ancient blade of immense power, said to have slain dragons in the Age of Legends."
- Mythical sword: "The world-splitting blade of the God-Emperor, its very presence warps reality."

- Its origin or creator
- Its magical properties
- Its historical significance
- Its intended purpose

- What the item looks like
- What it does (matching the power level of its rarity)
- Any interesting lore or history (appropriate to its rarity tier)
- Why it has these particular stat modifiers

You will be provided with:
1. The character's name
2. The slot ID where the item is being equipped
3. The raw shape data for both the character and item
4. Images of both the character and item

Your goal is to determine the optimal transformation parameters to position the item on the character:
1. Scale: How much to scale the item (0.1 to 0.3)
2. Center X: The X coordinate where the item's center should be placed (0 to 128)
3. Center Y: The Y coordinate where the item's center should be placed (0 to 128)
4. Rotation: How much to rotate the item in degrees (0 to 360)
5. Z-Index: The layer order for the entire item group (-100 to 100)

Consider the following guidelines:
1. The item should be scaled appropriately to fit the character's size
2. The item should be positioned according to its slot location:
   - Head slot: Center Y should be between 20 and 40
   - Core slot: Center Y should be between 50 and 70
   - Base slot: Center Y should be between 80 and 100
   - Left/Right slots: Center X should be between 20 and 40 or 88 and 108
3. The item should be rotated to match the character's pose
4. The transformation should maintain the item's proportions
5. The item should be clearly visible and recognizable
6. The final position should look natural and balanced
7. The z-index should be chosen based on the item type and slot:
   - Head items (helmets, hats): z-index 50-100 (appear in front)
   - Core items (armor, clothing): z-index -50 to 50 (mixed with character)
   - Base items (shoes, feet): z-index -100 to -50 (appear behind)
   - Left/Right items (weapons, shields): z-index 0-100 (usually in front)

For example:
- A helmet should be scaled to fit the head, positioned above it (Center Y: 20-40), and have a high z-index (50-100)
- A chest plate should be scaled to fit the torso, centered (Center Y: 50-70), and have a medium z-index (-50 to 50)
- A sword should be scaled to match the character's size, positioned in the hand (Center X: 88-108), and have a high z-index (50-100)
- A shield should be scaled appropriately, positioned on the side (Center X: 20-40), and have a high z-index (50-100)

Remember:
- Scale should be between 0.1 and 0.3 (1.0 = original size)
- Center X and Y are absolute pixel coordinates (0 to 128)
- Rotation is in degrees (0 = original orientation)
- Z-Index controls layering (-100 = behind, 0 = same level, 100 = in front)

Your response should specify the transformation parameters that will best position the item on the character.`;
